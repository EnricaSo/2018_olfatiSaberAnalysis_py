# Alpha alpha analysis

This projects allows to analyse the principle characteristics of a flock defined by the Alpha Alpha Protocol by Olfati Saber. The input must be provided in a csv file, containing positions, velocities and accelerations of the agents.

The outputs are the time of convergence of the swarm, the inter-agent distances (in terms of average, standard deviation, min and max), and elongation of the swarm (i.e. diameter of the sphere containing it).
